This began in the early 1990s, when my friends Queen Noor and the late King Hussein of Jourdan drew our attention to more than 100,000 refugees who had crossed from Iraq to Jordan during the first Gulf War. With the help of the Virgin family, we were able to mobilise great support and soon a shipment of urgently needed supplies was on its way to Amman.</p><p>25 years later, it feels as if there hasn‚Äôt been a year since when the world wasn‚Äôt faced with a refugee crisis ‚Äì be it in Burundi, Bosnia or Somalia, in Kosovo, Afghanistan or Darfur, or now, Syria. In all of these situations, those who really deserve to be celebrated are the remarkable men and women who give every waking minute to ease the suffering of those forced to leave their homes and their communities because of war, terror and bloodshed. I am talking about the humanitarian workers caring for tens of thousands in refugee camps in Kenya; the coast guard personnel lifting children out of the Mediterranean‚Äôs choppy waters; the doctors treating the sick and the wounded along the Turkish border; the volunteers distributing aid in Calais and Dunkirk; or the lawyers fighting bureaucracy and red tape to secure asylum for unaccompanied children. They all deserve our praise. They all deserve our support.</p>", "video"=>"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCsZLQdPoR4\" noresize=\"\" allowtransparency=\"\"></iframe>"}, "url"=>"", "text"=>"", "title"=>"", "rel"=>"", "email"=>"", "anchor"=>"", "alt"=>"", "alignment"=>"", "width"=>"560", "height"=>"315", "_wysihtml5_mode"=>"1", "scale"=>"full", "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"1"}

This began in the early 1990s, when my friends Queen Noor and the late King Hussein of Jourdan drew our attention to more than 100,000 refugees who had crossed from Iraq to Jordan during the first Gulf War. With the help of the Virgin family, we were able to mobilise great support and soon a shipment of urgently needed supplies was on its way to Amman.</p><p><img alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/www-virgin-com/f_auto,q_80/virgin-com-prod/sites/virgin.com/files/fullsizerender_3.jpg\" class=\"wysiwyg-float-left\">25 years later, it feels as if there hasn‚Äôt been a year since when the world wasn‚Äôt faced with a refugee crisis ‚Äì be it in Burundi, Bosnia or Somalia, in Kosovo, Afghanistan or Darfur, or now, Syria. In all of these situations, those who really deserve to be celebrated are the remarkable men and women who give every waking minute to ease the suffering of those forced to leave their homes and their communities because of war, terror and bloodshed.

This began in the early 1990s, when my friends Queen Noor and the late King Hussein of Jourdan drew our attention to more than 100,000 refugees who had crossed from Iraq to Jordan during the first Gulf War. With the help of the Virgin family, we were able to mobilise great support and soon a shipment of urgently needed supplies was on its way to Amman.</p><p>25 years later, it feels as if there hasn‚Äôt been a year since when<a target=\"\" rel=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20794575/facebook-twitter-buttons-with-turbolink\"> the world</a> wasn‚Äôt faced with a refugee crisis ‚Äì be it in Burundi, Bosnia or Somalia, in Kosovo, Afghanistan or Darfur, or now, Syria. In all of these situations, those who really deserve to be celebrated are the remarkable men and women who give every waking minute to ease the suffering of those forced to leave their homes and their communities because of war, terror and bloodshed. I am talking about the humanitarian workers caring for tens of thousands in refugee camps in Kenya; the coast guard personnel lifting children out of the Mediterranean‚Äôs choppy waters; the doctors treating the sick and the wounded along the Turkish border; the volunteers distributing aid in Calais and Dunkirk; or the lawyers fighting bureaucracy and red tape to secure asylum for unaccompanied children. They all deserve our praise. They all deserve our support.</p>\r\n<div class=\"w3-container\">\r\n    <div class=\" w3-padding w3-col s12 l6 m6\">\r\n        <img title=\"Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/www-virgin-com/f_auto,q_80/virgin-com-prod/sites/virgin.com/files/fullsizerender_3.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/www-virgin-com/f_auto,q_80/virgin-com-prod/sites/virgin.com/files/fullsizerender_3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\" w3-padding w3-col s12 l6 m6\">\r\n        <p>But the crisis continues. As we gathered in Washington, thousands stranded on Greek islands face the tough decision to move on or return to Turkey. Off the coast of Myanmar, refugees from the Rohingya minority are clinging to small boats by the hundreds, trying to escape from marginalisation, oppression and violence. In South Sudan, scores are on the move as their young nation tethers on the verge of collapse. When refugees become a commonplace occurrence, the greatest danger is indifference. Just last week, at least 400 refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea were reported to have drowned in the Mediterranean when the boat ferrying them from Egypt to Italy capsized. Their gruesome death was a fleeting item in the international news cycle. Their story had no faces, their suffering no narrative. What does it say about us when this immense tragedy at Europe‚Äôs borders isn‚Äôt even breaking news anymore?</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>", "video"=>"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCsZLQdPoR4\" noresize=\"\" allowtransparency=\"\"></iframe>"}, "url"=>"", "text"=>"", "title"=>"", "rel"=>"", "email"=>"", "anchor"=>"", "alt"=>"", "alignment"=>"", "width"=>"560", "height"=>"315", "_wysihtml5_mode"=>"1", "scale"=>"full", "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"1"}

I am talking about the humanitarian workers caring for tens of thousands in refugee camps in Kenya; the coast guard personnel lifting children out of the Mediterranean‚Äôs choppy waters; the doctors treating the sick and the wounded along the Turkish border; the volunteers distributing aid in Calais and Dunkirk; or the lawyers fighting bureaucracy and red tape to secure asylum for unaccompanied children.

As we gathered in Washington, thousands stranded on Greek islands face the tough decision to move on or return to Turkey. Off the coast of Myanmar, refugees from the Rohingya minority are clinging to small boats by the hundreds, trying to escape from marginalisation, oppression and violence. In South Sudan, scores are on the move as their young nation tethers on the verge of collapse. When refugees become a commonplace occurrence, the greatest danger is indifference. Just last week, at least 400 refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea were reported to have drowned in the Mediterranean when the boat ferrying them from Egypt to Italy capsized. Their gruesome death was a fleeting item in the international news cycle. Their story had no faces, their suffering no narrative.

In all of these situations, those who really deserve to be celebrated are the remarkable men and women who give every waking minute to ease the suffering of those forced to leave their homes and their communities because of war, terror and bloodshed. I am talking about the humanitarian workers caring for tens of thousands in refugee camps in Kenya; the coast guard personnel lifting children out of the Mediterranean‚Äôs choppy waters; the doctors treating the sick and the wounded along the Turkish border; the volunteers distributing aid in Calais and Dunkirk; or the lawyers fighting bureaucracy <a target=\"\" rel=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"\">and red tape to secure asylum for unaccompanied children</a>.

As we gathered in Washington, thousands stranded on Greek islands face the tough decision to move on or return to Turkey. Off the coast of Myanmar, refugees from the Rohingya minority are clinging to small boats by the hundreds, trying to escape from marginalisation, oppression and violence. In South Sudan, scores are on the move as their young nation tethers on the verge of collapse. When refugees become a commonplace occurrence, the greatest danger is indifference. Just last week, at least 400 refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea were reported to have drowned in the Mediterranean when the boat ferrying them from Egypt to Italy capsized. Their gruesome death was a fleeting item in the international news cycle. Their story had no faces, their suffering no narrative.
